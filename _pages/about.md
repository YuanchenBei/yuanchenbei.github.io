# üëã About Me
I am Yuanchen Bei, now a second-year master's student in the College of Computer Science and Technology, Zhejiang University, fortunately advised by Prof. [Sheng Zhou](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Ss76nMwAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao) and Prof. [Jiajun Bu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=OgZP2okAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao). I also gratefully work closely with Dr. [Hao Chen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=7oeLWT0AAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao) at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University and Prof. [Feiran Huang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=of1vcxsAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao) at Jinan University.

My research interests include **graph learning & its applications**, **industrial recommender systems**, and **efficient & scaleable graph models**. In my free time, I am also interested in finance and economics.

*I am looking for Ph.D. opportunities in Spring/Fall 2025, sincerely appreciate any opportunity!*
