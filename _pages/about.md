I am Yuanchen Bei, now a first-year master student in College of Computer Science and Technology, Zhejiang University, advised by professor [Sheng Zhou](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Ss76nMwAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao) and professor [Jiajun Bu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=OgZP2okAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao). I also work closely with Dr. [Hao Chen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=7oeLWT0AAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao) at PolyU and professor [Feiran Huang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=of1vcxsAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao) at Jinan University.

My research interest includes graph learning and its applications in recommender system & anomaly detection.
